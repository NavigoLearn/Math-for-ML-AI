## How to contribute
We have a simple set of rules for anyone who want to submit a pr and contribute

**PR RULES**
* When submitting a pr, justify why you think the resource should be added. We don't want to bloat the roadmap too much
* Make sure to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/kaxCNpQMKR) for discussions and suggestions 
 
**ROADMAP RULES**
 * Having 2 bullet on the same level are considered topics that come one after another
 * Having bullet points nested under another bullet point are considered subtopics of the bullet point above it
 * You can nest bullet points as deep as you want, but try to not go too deep
 * The descriptions should be added with a line ```-``` after its respective bullet point
 * Links should be added as ```[link name](link)``` as nested bullet points immediately under description 

**EXAMPLES**
* Calculus
    * Calculus I - calculus one encompasses bla bla bla some more description   
      * [Course 1](link) 
      * [Course 1](link) 
      * Subnode 1 - Another description here
        * [Subnode 1 link](link)
        * SubSubnode 1
        * SubSubnode 2
      * Subnode 2
      * Subnode 3
  * Calculus II
  * Calculus III

In this particular example, We have 3 main topics, calculus I, II and III. Calculus I has 3 subnodes and 2 links. The subnodes from calculus I should be followed in order, then you should get to Calculus II and III.
