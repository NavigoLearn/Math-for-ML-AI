	-  Calculus I - Calculus I forms the foundation for understanding changes and motion in machine learning models. It introduces key concepts like limits, which help understand how functions behave as they approach specific points, and derivatives, which are essential for understanding rates of change. In machine learning, derivatives play a crucial role in optimization algorithms, like gradient descent, used for training models. This part of calculus also covers the basics of integration, providing a way to aggregate or sum up quantities, which is useful in areas like probability and data analysis. Understanding the fundamentals of Calculus I is vital for grasping more complex concepts in machine learning and for effectively implementing and improving ML algorithms.

        - Binomial coefficients in probability - Binomial coefficients, represented as "n choose k", are used in probability to calculate the number of ways to choose k successes out of n trials. They are central to the binomial probability distribution, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. Understanding binomial coefficients is crucial for calculating probabilities in scenarios where there are two possible outcomes (like success or failure) in each trial and where each outcome has a fixed probability.

It's represented as P(A|B), the probability of event A occurring given that B has happened. This concept is essential in situations where the occurrence of one event affects the likelihood of another. For example, if you have a deck of cards and you know that a card drawn is red, the probability of it being a heart is different (and higher) than if you had no information about the card's color. Understanding conditional probability is key for analyzing scenarios where events are interrelated.

    - Standard deviation - Standard deviation is the square root of variance and provides a measure of the spread of data points around the mean in the same units as the data.

    - Normal distribution - A normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, is a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where most observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions.

    - Bayesian statistics -Bayesian statistics involves using Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

      - Bayes theorem - Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Formally, it calculates the conditional probability of an event A given another event B, based on the inverse probability of B given A and the individual probabilities of A and B. This theorem is widely used in various fields for making inferences and updating probabilities as new evidence is obtained. It's a cornerstone in Bayesian statistics, allowing for a mathematical framework to update beliefs based on new data.

    - Hypothesis testing and p-values - In hypothesis testing, the p-value is a measure used to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the observed data are unlikely under the null hypothesis and leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis, suggesting that the alternative hypothesis may be true. The p-value is a crucial tool in statistical significance testing, helping to determine whether the results of a study or experiment are likely due to chance or to some actual effect.

    - Regression - Regression is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between two or more variables. Essentially, it helps understand how the typical value of the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied. In its simplest form, linear regression, it's like fitting a straight line through data points in a way that best expresses the relationship between those points. It's widely used for prediction and forecasting, where it helps in determining how changes in one variable can affect another.

    - z-score - A z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. It's calculated as the difference between a raw score and the population mean, divided by the population standard deviation.

- Linear algebra -Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, vector spaces, and linear mappings between these spaces. It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspaces, and is fundamental for many areas of mathematics. In linear algebra, the concepts of vector operations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors are key. These concepts are essential for solving systems of linear equations, which is a common problem in various applied fields including computer science, engineering, physics, and economics. Linear algebra provides the language and framework for many modern areas of applied mathematics, including machine learning and data analysis, where it's used to model and solve complex problems.

    - Vectors - Vectors are mathematical objects representing quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They can be thought of as arrows pointing from one point to another in space. Vectors are fundamental in physics, engineering, and mathematics, particularly in fields like mechanics and vector calculus. In the context of linear algebra, vectors are often represented as an array of numbers which specify their coordinates in a space, and they are key to understanding concepts like vector spaces, linear transformations, and matrix operations. Vectors are also crucial in machine learning for representing data and model parameters.

    - Linear subspaces - Linear subspaces, also known simply as subspaces, are subsets of a vector space that are themselves vector spaces. They are defined by a few key properties: they contain the zero vector, they are closed under vector addition (meaning the sum of any two vectors in the subspace is also in the subspace), and they are closed under scalar multiplication (any scalar multiplied by a vector in the subspace results in another vector in the subspace). Subspaces are fundamental in linear algebra and are used to understand more complex structures within vector spaces, like the column space and null space of a matrix.

    - Vector dot and cross products -The dot product (or scalar product) of two vectors is a way of multiplying them to get a scalar (a single number).The cross product (or vector product) of two vectors is another way of multiplying them, but unlike the dot product, the result is a vector, not a scalar. The cross product vector is perpendicular to the plane formed by the two original vectors.
